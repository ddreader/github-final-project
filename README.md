# Simple Interest Calculator

A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

## Input

* `p`: Principal amount
* `t`: Time period in years
* `r`: Annual rate of interest

## Output

Simple interest = p * t * r

## Example

If you have:

* Principal (p) = $1000
* Time (t) = 2 years
* Rate (r) = 5% (or 0.05)

The simple interest is calculated as:

Simple interest = 1000 * 2 * 0.05 = $100

## Usage

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone <your_repository_url>`
2.  Navigate to the directory: `cd <your_repository_directory>`
3.  Run the script: `python calculate_interest.py <principal> <time> <rate>`
